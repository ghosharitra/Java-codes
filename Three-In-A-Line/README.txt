Player 1 starts first, and chooses a position to put his mark (below positions on the board needs to be marked), 
then next players does the same until the board is filled.

3.If you score a point you get another chance.
4.If you connect three symbols, the location taken indicated by S.

Features:

2. Size of the board can also be changed as desired.
3. The players can choose at the end of each round whether to play another round or not.
4. The board is displayed on the screen which refreshes each time player chooses a move by tying in a coordinate.
5. Result of each game is both displayed on the screen as well as counted and written on a file named 'results'.
